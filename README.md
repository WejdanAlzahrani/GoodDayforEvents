# Ride duration prediction 

## Project Proposal 
This project aims to build a ML model to predict the ride duration of bike sharing system's customers. 

# Dataset 
Our dataset is Bike Sharing Dataset and it can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/chirag02/ford-gobike-2019feb-tripdata).

# Tools
- Pandas 
- Seaborn, matplotlib and plotly for visualizing
- Sklearn and xgboost for modeling

# MVP Goal 
Is to have a model that is capable of predicting the ride duration.
